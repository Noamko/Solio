## Overview

Solio ("the App") is a music note reading trainer developed by noamk. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to being transparent about our data practices.

**The short version:** Solio does not collect, store, or share any personal data. Everything stays on your device.

Solio does **not** collect:
- Personal information (name, email, phone number)
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- Usage analytics

- Any data sent to external servers

### What Is Stored Locally

Solio stores the following data **only on your device**:
- **Practice Statistics** — Number of notes practiced, correct answers, and accuracy percentages
- **Daily Progress** — Practice time and performance metrics organized by date
- **Note Performance** — Your accuracy for each individual note (Do, Re, Mi, etc.)
- **App Preferences** — Your selected settings (difficulty, clef, notation style, sound preferences)

This data is stored using Apple's UserDefaults system and **never leaves your device**.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect any data.

## Third-Party Services
